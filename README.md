# Note-ary

_Good things come in pairs_ The backend uses `express`/`sequelize` and the frontend uses `react`/`redux`. 

## Setup 

* Create two postgres databases 

``` 
createdb note-ary 
createdb note-ary-test 
``` 

* Run databases

```
npm run seed

```


Running `npm run start-dev` will make great things happen! 

If you want to run the server and/or `webpack` separately, you can also 
`npm run start-server` and `npm run build-client`. From there, just follow your bliss.
